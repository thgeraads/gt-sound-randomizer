# gt-sound-randomizer
A PyQt5-based GUI Program made to randomize Growtopia game sounds.

_Note: Modifying the Growtopia game files is technically illegal and might get you punished. Although its hard for the game to see that you've modified anything, I'm not responsible for anything that happens to your account/game._

# Installation

1. Download and install Python 3.8 (obviously)
2. Download the .py file from the releases tab
3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `randomizer.py` file


# Usage
### Before running, **make sure that the game is closed.**
1. Before randomizing, click `Backup` to ensure that you can go back to the original sounds and wait untill it says `Status: backed up.`
2. When backed up, click `Randomize!` **and wait** untill the green text says `Ready to launch Growtopia`. Then launch the game manually
3. When the game is launched, login. It will update ~90 items total. These are the modified sound files moving to the cache (You don't want these.)
4. When that's done, hit the `Clear cache folder` button. Do this every time you launch Growtopia if needed.
5. You're done! If you ever want to go back to the original sounds just click `Restore` and wait a few seconds.

This program is a bit ubstable. Only click a button **once** and then just wait until you get a response.
If at any time the program stops responding, **just wait** untill the window becomes responsive again. It just does that sometimes.
